The linux kernel supports almost all snapdragon 8cx SoCs:
- [gen 1 SC8180X Lenovo Flex 5G kernel 6.5](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.0)
- [gen 3 SC8280XP Lenovo Thinkpad X13s kernel 6.0](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.5)
- [gen 4 /X Elite X1E80100 kernel 6.8](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.8)

Snapdragon 8cx gen 2 SC8180XP of Lenovo IdeaPad 5G 14Q8X05 is the evolution of the Flex one with the same CPU-GPU, but at higher frequency, with BT 5.1 and WiFi 6 instead of BT 5 and WiFi 5.


[Qualcomm has announced Upstreaming Linux kernel support for the Snapdragon X Elite.](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/05/upstreaming-linux-kernel-support-for-the-snapdragon-x-elite)

<em>Collaborating with Lenovo, Arm and Linaro on the AArch64 laptops GitHub project, we’ve built Linux support into several generations of our SoCs with Windows on Snapdragon. We’ve ensured that you could boot Linux on many of the laptops powered by our previous generation of SoCs. Notable models include the Lenovo Yoga C630 (Snapdragon 850), the Lenovo Flex 5G (Snapdragon 8cx Gen 1) and the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s (Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3).</em>

In the description, all SoC 8cx are included except the unfortunate gen 2 (SC8180XP). Who knows why it is the only one excluded.
